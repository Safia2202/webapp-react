        description: 'How to make chicken satay :\nMake the marinade.In a bowl, combine minced lemongrass, shallots, and garlic along with oil, fish sauce, sugar, turmeric, coriander, and cumin. If you have a food processor, you can chop all the ingredients together. If you want to be super authentic, you can use a mortar and pestle to pound the lemongrass, shallot, and garlic before stirring in the oil, fish sauce, and spices. \nCut the chicken and marinate. Cut the chicken into small even 1 inch pieces and combine throughly with the marinade. Make sure all the pieces are covered. Marinate for minimum 1 hour, overnight is best!Soak the skewers. Bamboo skewers are perfect for satay. I like to use the 6 inch sticks which fit about 4 to 6 pieces of chicken. Soak for about 30 minutes. Any longer, and they’ll start to warp and loose their structural integrity.Skewer. Skewer 4-6 pieces on to each skewer, nestling the pieces right next to each other so they are touching. Use gloves if you have them otherwise your hands will smell like cumin and be stained with turmeric!Grill. Grill the skewers over medium heat, flipping occasionally, until they are golden, juicy, charred, and cooked though. Enjoy!'

        description:'How to make fluffy Japanese pancakes.Mix. Mix the egg yolk and sugar until frothy, then mix in the milk. Sift in the flour and baking powder, making a smooth batter. Set aside.Whip. Make the meringue by beating together sugar, egg whites, and cream of tartar. When the egg whites hold their shape and are stiff and glossy, they’re ready.Incorporate. Fold the egg yolk batter into the whites, being careful not to deflate. Cook. Heat up a pan (or a crepe maker) on very, very low heat. Lightly oil the pan then scoop out a large dollop of batter, cover and cook for 4-5 minutes. Remove the lid then pile some more batter on and add a couple drops of water. Cover and cook. When the bottoms are golden, very carefully flip, add a couple more drops of water, then cover and cook. Remove from the pan and enjoy immediately with butter, syrup, and powdered sugar. The pancakes will deflate as they cool down.'

        description:'How to make a Korean corn dog: Assemble. Start by cutting the hot dogs in half. Cut the block of mozzarella cheese into sticks roughly the size of the halved hot dogs. Use a stick and skewer, hot dog, then cheese. Place in the fridge to keep them cold. Make the batter. In a bowl, mix together flour, milk, an egg, baking powder, sugar, and a pinch of salt until thick and smooth. Pour the batter into a tall cup so it’s easier to dip the hot dogs. Like the hot dogs and cheese, it’s best to keep this in the fridge so it stays cold.Dip. Hold on to the stick and dip the hot dogs, coating completely, making sure that the batter is clinging to the hot dog and cheese.Coat. Immediately take the battered hot dog and coat it in panko, being sure to press on the panko gently, ensuring that it’s completely coated in panko.Fry. Heat up the oil over medium high heat. You want the oil temperature to be between 350°F and 375°F. When you add your corn dogs, the oil temp will drop, so aim for 375°F to start with. I use an instant read thermometer to make sure I’m in the right range. Fry the coated corn dogs, without crowding until golden and crispy. Use a pair or tongs or a slotted spoon to carefully scoop them out and let them drain on wire rack.Enjoy. Sprinkle or roll the golden corn dog in sugar and finish with a squiggle of ketchup, mustard, or both.'
